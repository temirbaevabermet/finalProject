In this project I chose a topic related to high technology. It consists of a navigation menu that helps you move easily between pages. 
Depending on the size of the gadget, the sizes of texts and pictures will change accordingly.
The first page is the main page where you can see the company logo, pictures, texts related to the topic, etc. 
Next is a page that talks about the company itself, what they do and what their main goal is. 
The third page talks about services, describing two services in detail. In addition to these pages, there is a logout button, which, when clicked, will log you out of the main page of the website.
In the project I used grids and flexes, and of course different types of styling via CSS.
I also worked with a Java script to create such a navigation menu where it will fold when the gadget screen is less than a certain value.
I also used gradients to decorate the texts with beautiful colors.
